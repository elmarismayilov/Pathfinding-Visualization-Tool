This is a Dijkstra's algorithm Visualization tool written in C++ using Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). An example graph was used in this project, but any graph can be used. If you want to use another graph, you should change the value of V ( number of nodes ) on the line 6 to the number of nodes you want, ensure that matrix is initialized correctly with new number of vertices, and add edges in the test_graph function on the line 30.  Some of the code related to SFML was generated or modified with the assistance of ChatGPT, while the logic was written by me. If you find any errors or have any questions, feel free to contact me at: elmarismayilovstudent@gmail.com.
